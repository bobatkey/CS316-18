{- GHOUL : Global Higher-order Untyped Language                       -}
{----------------------------------------------------------------------}

{- INTRODUCTION TO GHOUL

   This exercise is about building an interpreters for a functional
   language called "GHOUL". It will bring together all of the concepts
   you have learned during this course.

   Here is an example GHOUL program (written using 'unlines' to allow
   multiple lines): -}

plusProgram :: String
plusProgram = unlines
  [ "(plus Z     y) -> y"
  , "(plus (S x) y) -> (S (plus x y))"
  , "(main)         -> (plus (S (S Z)) (S (S Z)))"
  ]

{- Execution of GHOUL programs works by starting from the 'main'
   function and then matching each function application against the
   patterns defined for that function to get an expression to replace
   that application with. This continues until there are no more
   expressions to replace. Data is built from constructors
   (identifiers that start with capital letters) applied to other
   constructors.

   For our example program, we have:

         (main)
      -> (plus (S (S Z)) (S (S Z)))
      -> (S (plus (S Z) (S (S Z))))
      -> (S (S (plus Z (S (S Z)))))
      -> (S (S (S (S Z))))

   So "two plus two is four".

   GHOUL is similar to Haskell, except that there are no types and
   there are no lambda expressions (\x -> ...).

   In this exercise, you will build a GHOUL interpreter, and extend it
   with additional features.

   In general, all interpreters perform the following steps:

     1. Parse the input -- take a representation of a program as a
        list of characters and turn it into abstract syntax. You will
        do this using parser combinators.

     2. Post-process and check the input, often called "Elaboration"
        or "Type Checking". In Haskell this is a complex stage
        involving desugaring, type inference, and typeclass
        resolution. For GHOUL, you will write some code to perform
        some well-formedness checks on the program.

     3. Execute the program. In Lecture 11, we showed you evaluators
        for several very simple languages. GHOUL has three features that
        make evaluation more complex:

          a. Variables
          b. Named function definitions.
          c. Pattern matching.

   These steps are summed up by the function that parses, checks, and
   executes GHOUL programs: -}

runGHOUL :: String -> ErrorOr (ErrorOr Value)
runGHOUL text = do
  prog <- parseAllInput pProgram text
  checkProgram prog
  return (evalProgram prog)


{- 'runGHOUL' accepts a String containing a GHOUL program, parses it,
   elaborates it, checks it, and executes it. If any of these steps
   fail, an error message is returned. Otherwise, the result of
   evaluating the program is returned.

   Errors are tracked by using this datatype. The result of a
   computation is either 'OK x' with some value 'x', or 'Error msg'
   where 'msg' is some hopefully helpful error message. -}

data ErrorOr a
  = OK a
  | Error String
  deriving Show

{- The 'ErrorOr' type is an instance of 'Monad', 'Functor',
   'Applicative' and 'Alternative'. The code implementing these
   interfaces in the appendix below. Apart from these interfaces,
   'ErrorOr' gives us a way of reporting errors: -}

abortWithMessage :: String -> ErrorOr a
abortWithMessage s = Error s

{- Of course, 'runGHOUL' doesn't work yet -- you will need to fill in
   the details below.

   When you've written at least the parser and evaluator parts, you
   should be able to use 'runGHOUL' to run a GHOUL program:

         Î»> runGHOUL plusProgram
         OK (OK (VC "S" [VC "S" [VC "S" [VC "S" [VC "Z" []]]]]))

   This exercise is structured so that you can implement a basic GHOUL
   evaluator first, and then go back to extend it with additional
   features for extra marks. As with the previous exercises, roughly a
   third of the marks will only be available during the class test on
   Monday 26th November. -}

{- Part 0 : ABSTRACT SYNTAX                                           -}
{----------------------------------------------------------------------}

{- Before we can write an interpreter for GHOUL programs, we need to
   describe what the syntax of GHOUL programs is. Generalising from
   the 'plus' example above, a GHOUL program is:

     - a list of rules, such as:

           (plus Z y)     -> y
           (plus (S x) y) -> (S (plus x y))
           (main)         -> (plus (S (S Z)) (S (S Z)))

       where:

     - a rule is a name and a list of patterns, surrounded by
       parentheses, followed by an arrow '->' and then an
       expression. For example:

           (plus Z y)     -> y
         or
           (plus (S x) y) -> (S (plus x y))

       where:

     - a pattern is a variable name (first letter lower case) or a
       constructor name (first letter upper case) on its own, or a
       constructor name followed by a space separated list of
       patterns, surrounded by parentheses. Examples:

                 Z
            or   (S Z)
            or   x
            or   (Cons x y)

       and

     - an expression is a variable name, a constructor name, or an
       application of a function to space separated list of
       expressions, surrounded by parentheses, or an application of a
       constructor name to expressions, surrounded by parentheses. For
       example:

                 (S (plus x y))
            or   (plus x y)
            or   Z
            or   x

   Also, there must be a rule named 'main' with no patterns.

   Following this description, we represent GHOUL programs as values
   of the type 'Program', where a 'Program' is a list of rules. -}

type Program = [Rule]

{- As we mentioned above, rules

        (plus Z y) -> y

   consist of:

    1. a name (e.g., "plus", "main")

    2. a list of patterns (patterns are defined below)

    3. an expression for the right hand side (expressions are defined
       below).

   We write a type for representing equations like so: -}

data Rule = MkRule String [Pat] Exp
  deriving (Show, Eq)

{- A pattern is either a variable (PV), or a constructor name and a list
   of patterns (PC). This is similar to patterns in Haskell, except
   that GHOUL does not have a "catch all" pattern '_'. -}

data Pat
  = PV String
  | PC String [Pat]
  deriving (Show, Eq)

{- Here are some example 'Pat's:

   - A GHOUL variable pattern 'y' is represented by the Haskell value
     'PV "y"'.

   - A GHOUL pattern matching a constructor with no arguments,
     e.g. 'Nil', is represented by the Haskell value 'PC "Nil" []'.

   - A GHOUL pattern matching a constructor with some arguments,
     e.g. '(Cons x Nil)', is represented by the Haskell value
     'PC "Cons" [PV "x", PC "Nil" []]'.

   An expression is either a variable (EV), an application of a named
   function (EA) or a an application of a constructor (EC). -}

data Exp
  = EV String
  | EA String [Exp]
  | EC String [Exp]
  deriving (Show, Eq)

{- Here are some example 'Exp's:

   - A GHOUL variable 'x' is represented by the Haskell value
     'EV "x"'.

   - A GHOUL function application '(f x y)' is represented by the
     Haskell value 'EA "f" [EV "x", EV "y"]'.

   - A GHOUL constructor with no arguments, e.g. 'Nil' is represented
     as 'EC "Nil" []'.

   - A GHOUL constructor with some arguments, e.g., '(Cons x Nil)' is
     represented as 'EC "Cons" [EV "x", EC "Nil" []]'.

   Note that in the GHOUL syntax, patterns are a subset of
   expressions, but when we represent them in Haskell they are in two
   separate data types. The job of working out which bits of a GHOUL
   program are patterns and which bits are expressions is done by the
   parser you will define below.

   Here are some example 'Rule's:

   - A GHOUL rule with no arguments:

         (main) -> (plus Z Z)

     is represented by the Haskell value:

         MkRule "main" [] (EA "plus" [EC "Z" [], EC "Z" []])

   - A GHOUL rule with two arguments:

         (eq Z Z) -> True

     is represented by the Haskell value:

         MkRule "eq" [PC "Z" [], PC "Z" []] (EC "True" [])

   Here is an example 'Program', representing the example program
   'plus' we saw above. -}

plusProgramAST :: Program
plusProgramAST =
  [ MkRule "plus"
           [PC "Z" [], PV "y"]
           (EV "y")
  , MkRule "plus"
           [PC "S" [PV "x"], PV "y"]
           (EC "S" [EA "plus" [EV"x", EV"y"]])
  , MkRule "main"
           []
           (EA "plus" [EC "S" [EC "S" [EC "Z" []]],
                       EC "S" [EC "S" [EC "Z" []]]])

{- GHOUL programs have variables in them. To keep track of what each
   variable means by during execution, we use environments. An
   environment is Map, associating values to names: -}

type Env = Map String Value

{- The 'Map' data type is provided by the Data.Map module imported at
   the start of this file. The 'Map' type takes two arguments: the
   first is the type of keys (here 'String's representing names), and
   the second is the type of values (here 'Value', representing GHOUL
   values).

   The Data.Map module provides a rich interface for querying and
   updating 'Map's. The module has been imported as 'qualified M',
   meaning that the functions from this module need to be prefixed by
   'M.' to be used. This is to avoid name clashes.

   For this exercise, you will need the following functions that build
   and manipulate 'Map's (use ':t <functioname>' in GHCi to look at
   the types as well):

      M.empty           -- the empty Map

      M.lookup k m      -- looks up the value of the key 'k' in 'm'.
                           Returns 'Just v' if the value 'v' is
                           associated with 'k' in 'm'. Otherwise,
                           returns 'Nothing'.

      M.insert k v m    -- returns a new map that has the same key->value
                           mapping as 'm' except that now 'k' has the
                           value 'v'.

      M.fromList kvs    -- constructs a 'Map' from a list 'kvs' of
                           (key,value) pairs. If a key is repeated, then
                           the last value is taken.

   For example, the empty environment (no variables have values) is the
   empty map:

        M.empty
     or
        M.fromList []

   An environment that assigns the GHOUL value 'Z' to 'x' and '(S Z)'
   to 'y' is the list:

        M.insert "x" (VC "Z" []) (M.insert "y" (VC "S" [VC "Z" []]) M.empty)
     or
        M.fromList [ ("x", VC "Z" [])
                   , ("y", VC "S" [VC "Z" []])
                   ]

    We look up the values assigned to variables in an environment
    using the 'M.lookup' function:

       > let env = M.fromList [ ("x", VC "Z" []), ("y", VC "S" [VC "Z" []]) ]
       > M.lookup "x" env
       Just (VC "Z" [])

{- 4.1.1 Binding Variables

   Implement the function 'bindVar' that acts like 'M.insert' except
   that a call:

          bindVar x value env

   acts as follows:

     - if the variable 'x' is already in the environment, then it
       returns 'Error' with a suitable error message.

     - if the variable 'x' is not in the environment, it inserts it
       into 'env' to get 'newEnv' and returns 'OK newEnv'.

   Examples:

         bindVar "x" (VC "Z" []) M.empty
      == OK (M.fromList [("x", VC "Z" [])])

         bindVar "x" (VC "Z" []) (M.insert "x" (VC "Nil" []) M.empty)

{- Part 2 : PATTERN MATCHING                                          -}
{----------------------------------------------------------------------}

{- Execution of a GHOUL program alternates between choosing which rule
   to use, and then evaluating the right-hand side of that
   rule. Choosing rules is accomplished by pattern matching. Matching
   a pattern against a value updates an environment to bind variables
   in the pattern to values. For example (using GHOUL syntax for
   brevity):

    - Matching the pattern 'x' against any value 'v' will bind 'x' to
      'v'.

    - Matching the pattern '(S x)' against the value '(S Z)' will bind
      'x' to the value 'Z'.

    - Matching the pattern '(S x)' against the value 'Z' will fail,
      because the constructors 'S' and 'Z' do not match.

   We will be matching lists of patterns against lists of values. A
   tempting way to pair up patterns with values for matching is to use
   the 'zip' function from the Haskell library. However, if the input
   lists are different lengths, then the standard 'zip' ignores all
   the extra elements in the longer list. So we define our own
   'zipChecked' function that uses a 'Maybe' to signal when the lists
   are different lengths. -}

zipChecked :: [a] -> [b] -> ErrorOr [(a,b)]
zipChecked xs ys = go xs ys []
  where go []     []     zs = return (reverse zs)
        go (x:xs) (y:ys) zs = go xs ys ((x,y):zs)
        go _      _      _  = abortWithMessage "lists of different lengths"


{- 4.2.0 Matching patterns and lists of patterns.

         Write the functions 'matchPattern' and 'matchPatterns'.

   'matchPattern' takes a pair of a pattern and a value and an
   environment and returns a possibly updated environment. This ought
   to implement pattern matching:

     - matching a variable against any value binds the variable to the
       value (using 'bindVar').

     - matching a constructor pattern against a value checks that the
       value has a constructor with the same name, and that the
       sub-patterns match the sub-values. Use the 'zipChecked'
       function we gave you above, which checks that two lists have
       the same length.

   'matchPatterns' takes a list of pattern-value paris and an
   environment and updates the environment according to running
   'matchPattern' on each pair in turn. If any of the patterns fails
   to match, then 'matchPatterns' should fail (by returning Nothing).

   Writing 'matchPattern' to use 'matchPatterns' will be easier than
   trying to do everything inside 'matchPattern'.

   Some test cases:

     > matchPattern (PV "x", VC "S" [VC "Z" []]) M.empty
     OK (fromList [("x",VC "S" [VC "Z" []])])

     > matchPattern (PC "S" [PV "x"], VC "S" [VC "Z" []]) M.empty

{- 4.2.1 Finding Rules by Pattern Matching

   Write a function that, given a name and a list of values, searches
   a 'Program' for the first rule that matches. That is, the names
   should match, and the patterns of the equation should match the
   list of values. On success, you should return the expression
   associated with that rule and the environment built from doing the
   pattern match.

   typeclass functions 'empty' and '<|>' to represent failure to find
   a rule and ordered choice, respectively.

     - The 'Env'ironment that describes what values are assigned to
       what variables.

     - The 'Exp'ression to evaluate.

   It returns a computation in the 'Eval' monad.

   Evaluation proceeds like so:

     - If the expression is a variable 'EV var', then look up that
       variable in the environment. If it is not there then abort with
       an appropriate error message.

     - If the expression is a constructor 'EC c args', then evaluate
       all the arguments (you might find the 'traverse' function
       useful here). Then return 'VC c' applied to the result of
       evaluating all the 'args'.

{- Writing GHOUL programs as values of type 'Program' is all very well,
   but not very friendly. Instead, we will build a parser and
   elaborator that will take a String that represents a GHOUL program
   and turn it into a list of equations. A list of equations is not
   yet a program, so Part 2 will build an elaborator to convert lists
   of equations into proper 'Program's.

   You will build your parser using parser combinators, as introduced
   in Lecture 13. Unlike in Lecture 13, we will write parsers that
   produce error messages rather than just returning 'Nothing' on
   failure. -}

     - 'identifier' to parse identifiers: sequences of letters and numbers
       that must start with a letter.
     - 'spaces' to parse zero or more white space characters.
     - 'sepBy' to parse lists of things separated by something.

   check for mistakes:

     - Not having a 'main' function, or the main function taking
       arguments. (Question 4.5.0 below).

     - Using variables on the right-hand side of an equation that are
       not mentioned in the pattern on the left-hand side (Question
       4.5.1, below). For example:

          (plus Z x) -> y

       This equation will always fail during execution, because there

{- 4.6.0 Built-in arithmetic

   As it stands, GHOUL is reasonably expressive but not very
   efficient. One source of inefficency is the fact that numbers are
   represented as sequences of 'S's followed by a 'Z'. This makes
   almost all operations on numbers take time linearly proportional to
   the size of the number, not to mention the wasted memory space.

   A more efficient approach would be to use Haskell's built in
   integer arithmetic for numbers. In this question, you should extend
   the GHOUL system so that it has support for values that are
   represented by Haskell values of type 'Int'.

   You will need to:

     1. Extend the type of 'Exp'ressions so that they can include 'Int'
        constants.

     2. Extend the type of 'Value's so that values can be 'Int's as
        well as constructors applied to values. You'll also have to
        extend 'ppValue'.

     3. Extend expression evaluation so that special arithmetic
        functions are recognised and specially handled. At least you
        should implement 'add' that adds two 'Int' values, and 'eq'
        that compares two 'Int's for equality and returns 'True' if
        they are equal and 'False' otherwise.

     4. Extend the parser to allow for 'Int' constants (use the
        'number' parser defined below).

     5. (Optional) extend the pattern matcher so that it allows
        matching 'Int's as well a constructors.
